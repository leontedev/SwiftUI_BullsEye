* BullsEye
First challenge of the SwiftUI by Tutorials book: https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/swiftui-by-tutorials
Convert an UIKit application to SwiftUI. 
A simple game to try to estimate a random generated value between 1...100 on a slider. If the user places the slider dead on - it will show a "Bull's Eye!" alert.

Customizing the Slider with a custom set of bounds and a step parameter was interesting.
#+BEGIN_SRC Swift
Slider(value: $guess, in: 0.0...100.0, step: 1.0)
#+END_SRC
